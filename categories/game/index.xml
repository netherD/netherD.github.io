      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was addicted to the game of Civilization VI in the last few days, through it is time consuming, I learned alot about history, technology, politics, military, different kinds of civilizations and wonders of the world. What is more, I gradually realize that it is so hard to control yourself to throw nuclear bombs once you have it, and you will be more grateful about the peaceful world you have now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
